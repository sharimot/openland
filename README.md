# Openland: Where Everything is Free

While traveling the metaverse, I saw the most beautiful sight that I have ever seen: a world full of happy people enjoying their lives.
This idyllic yet ethereal paradise could be characterized by one word: abundance.
All goods, both tangible and intangible, were not just plentiful but wonderful.
A passerby told me that people call this world Openland and that everything in this society is freely accessible.
As I sat on a bench, wondering how such a world is even possible, an old man walked up to me and started talking pleasantly about a fascinating story of this floating city that lay forty thousand feet above the cloud.

This is what he told me...

Once upon a time, there was a walled kingdom called Shutland.
Throughout the kingdom, there was an endless array of walls and gates that imprisoned information.
Shutlanders called these barriers intellectual property rights, shutting access to information  and hiding information behind paywalls.
Due to the shadows of these high walls, this kingdom was always dark.

They worshiped a strange tool called copyright, a tool intended to help creative workers by making non-excludable things excludable.
Of course, it didn't work.
Creative workers were underpaid despite their invaluable labor.
The creative industry was so small that you needed a microscope to observe it.
"Free" content on the web was accompanied by inefficient ads and was mostly junk.

Patents and secrets obstructed the free use of knowledge and spawned monopolies.
Whenever there was an infringement of intellectual property, they had to wait for the top-down judgment of the king.
They tried alternatives like altruism and subsidies, but none of them worked.

As a result, the pace at which knowledge was accumulated and shared was unbelievably slow.
Shutland suffered from a famine of information, but alas, they didn't even realize how terrible their country was!

When Shutlanders were living dismal lives, Tim Berners-Lee, a visionary living in Shutland, crafted a token representing his greatest creation &dash; the source code of the world wide web &dash; and then sold it.
All while keeping the source code itself freely available to anyone.
Shutlanders were puzzled due to its invisible nature, but for the first time ever, he brilliantly demonstrated that it's possible to profit from the production of information while making it accessible to the public.

Seeing the potential of this new paradigm, a handful of enthusiasts gathered and set out to establish a new nation: Openland.
They drafted a declaration of Openland, imagining a brighter future where ideas flourish.

And it goes like this:

<p align="center">Declaration of Openland</p>

Dear Shutland,

Do you remember how much you paid for the information that transformed you?
We are going to solve your problems in the most bizarre way possible.
We are going to equip the current broken cyberspace with a clever incentive structure and a new business model.

Introducing: Openland Tokens (OLTs)

OLTs are one-of-a-kind tokens that obey the principles, ideals, and dreams of Openland, whose mission is to create a rich society by radically liberating art and wisdom.
Hence, not all tokens qualify as OLTs; OLTs must represent digital public goods that benefit the entire world.
We reject all kinds of stupidity ranging from pictures of monkeys to a collection of rocks.
Think of OLTs as gemstones of ideas scattered around Openland.
We see OLT mining not as zero-sum gambling but as healthy risk-taking that pushes our society forward.

Also, OLTs must be bound to the soul of their creators and should never be sold.
Instead, creators should [print](https://github.com/sharimot/printer) their OLTs and sell the prints.
We all know how powerful fungibility is.
OLTs never lack utility; the purchase of OLT prints is how we store wealth, or how we transfer wealth from banks to artists.
Printing is beneficial to creators; just as cherry seeds grow into fine trees that bloom every year and present us with cherries and new seeds, printed OLTs reward creators forever.

To live in Openland is to cherish these rules:

- Be a selfish philanthropist.
- Don't look at charts.
- Discover unknown artists.
- Judge ownership in a bottom-up fashion.

Builders from every corner of Openland come together and cooperate for the greater good: the digital commons &dash; a free library anyone can enter and a vast fresco anyone can edit.

Today, we abolish all forms of intellectual property.
You may say we're dreamers, but we hope you join us!

Openland was built on top of Ethereum, a magic stone levitating this eternal city above the ground.
Ethereum was chosen because it was more composable, reliable, scalable, sustainable, unstoppable, and verifiable than anything else.

Impressed by the vision, many Shutlanders settled here.
What happened next was truly amazing.
Siloed information was unleashed from cages.
Countless new technologies were created.
An explosion of quality data occurred.
It became easier to spot valuable ideas.
The result was a highly efficient society abounding with tangible goods.

While many had already migrated to the new republic, some remained in the kingdom.
They labeled us scammers, gamblers, money launderers, etc.
"If we do not own the copyright of a book or the patent of a device, how can you buy or sell intellectual property? The idea is strange to us."
They even fired anti-openness missiles.
Openland had to rise high above the sky.
To showcase what life in Openland looked like, we brought back all sorts of goods created here in Openland.
At first they couldn't believe their eyes, but eventually, they all realized Shutland was no longer a nice place to live.
They then freed every single intellectual property that they have created, and dedicated them all to the public domain.
We forgave them and welcomed them.
We became friends as equal citizens of Openland and we all lived happily ever after.
